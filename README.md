# MIT Pokerbots Engine 2026
MIT Pokerbots engine and skeleton bots in Python, Java, and C++.

This is the implementation of the engine for playing this year's poker variant, where you get 3 hole cards pre-flop, and you choose a card to discard face up after the flop.

## Setup Instructions
Our engine runs in Python, and to make setup as smooth as possible we can make use of [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a powerful tool which handles package management, virtual environments, etc.

> <u>__NOTE: We strongly recommend trying out `uv` even if you are already familiar with tools such as `pip` and `pyenv`__</u>

To install `uv`, you can use the following:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 

# Windows (Powershell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Now, after installing `uv` and cloning the repo, run the following commands inside the repo:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment with a recent Python version chosen by uv
uv venv

# Optional: you can also use any Python version of your choice >=3.8, using e.g. `uv venv --python 3.13.3`

# Sync the virtual environment with the given project files (pyproject.toml and uv.lock), which basically installs the dependencies:
# - cython 3.2.3 (needed for pkrbot)
# - pkrbot 1.0.4 (custom library used for hand evaluation)
uv sync
```

That's it! There is no need to download the necessary python versions beforehand since `uv` will attempt to find it and install it if necessary.

Now, to finally run the engine, you can use the Python executable inside of the virtual environment (should be at `<PROJECT_DIR>/.venv/bin/python`) and run `engine.py`. To change the bots which are run, see `config.py`.

### C++ Specific Instructions
If you are writing a bot in C++, you should make sure that you have `C++17`, `cmake>=3.8`, and `boost`, a versatile library which we use for stream-oriented network communication.

There are many ways to install C++ and `cmake` on your machine, but ultimately you want to make sure that your versions are high enough with these commands:

```bash
cmake --version   # should be 3.8 or higher

# Check either g++ or clang++ depending on which compiler you are using
g++ --version     # should show something like g++ (GCC) 10.x or newer
clang++ --version # should show something like Apple clang version 10.x or newer
```

Now, to get `boost`, you can use the following:

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev 

# macOS
brew install boost                      

# Windows (C++ bots must use WSL)
wsl --install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libboost-all-dev                   
```

> NOTE: For the macOS command to work, you must first install `brew`, with this command:
> 
> ```bash
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
> ```
>
> Now brew should work as needed. If boost is not auto-detected after installing with brew, use
>
> ```bash
> cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/homebrew -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
> ```


### Java Specific Instructions
If you are writing a bot in Java, you should make sure that you have `Java>=8` installed on your machine. 

If `java -version` fails or shows a version <1.8, install Java using the instructions below. After installing, use `java -version` again to verify successful installation.

#### macOS

The recommended version is with brew:
```bash
brew install --cask temurin
```

It is also possible to download manually from: [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net).

> NOTE: If java is not found after installing (macOS only), use: 
> ```bash
> echo 'export PATH="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
> ```

#### Linux
You can simply run the commands below:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk
```

#### Windows

You can download manually from: [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net), install using the `.msi` installer, and make sure "Add to PATH" is checked.
